## Notes to Start
This package is aimed at provision of responsive design for mobiles and tablets for core features of the Gibbon Education programme.  This program does not work without the Gibbon Software installed and working.

If you have been running Gibbon by itself for a while then your web server is probably already set and ready to go. You need to perform a number of steps to take your server from Gibbon to Gibbon and Gibbon Responsive.

1. [Setup your server to manage multiple web sites](/Install/ApacheStandalone/)
2. [Create a new virtual host on your server](/Install/Apache-2.4/)
3. [Install Gibbon Responsive](/Install/Production/)

#### Version 0.0.09 is a release candidate for Gibbon v17.0.00
#### Version 0.1.00 is the current nightly build for Gibbon v18.0.00
