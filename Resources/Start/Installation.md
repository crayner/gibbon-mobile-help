#Gibbon Mobile

This package is aimed at provision of responsive design for mobiles and tablets for core features of the Gibbon Education programme.

###Version 0.0.02

_**This package is currently in development, and changes made until release may not be backwards compatible.**_

###Installation

####Server Requirements

1.  Apache 2.2/2.4 or Nginx 1.12+
2.  PHP 7.1 or above (with PDO, gettext, CURL. Recommended to turn display_errors off.)
3.  MySQL 5+ or MariaDB 10+ (collation set to utf8_general_ci)
4.  Gibbon 17.0.00+
5.  As you are dealing with sensitive data over an open communication system, I recomment that all communication to Gibbon and Gibbon Mobile be made using https communication protocol (SSL).  This will require a yearly cost for an appropriate security certificate or two.  Speak to your server provider or your ICT support people for how to do this important step. 

#### File Structure
Installation is most easily done using composer.  Install composer on your PHP server is relatively easy with [comprehensive Composer instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) available.

Create your directory on your server to hold the Gibbon Mobile Project, then changege to that directory.  The directory should NOT be inside your Gibbon installation.  So you may have a directory structure like:

* var
    * www
        * html
        * gibbon
        
then you would add another directory called 'mobile' to the www directory.  The thi case the Gibbon Document Root is __/var/www/gibbon__  and the Gibbon Mobile directory would be __/var/www/mobile__ and the Gibbon Mobile document root would be __/var/www/mobile/public__  
The package comes with a .htaccess file in the public directory, so your virtualhost configuration should point your Gibbon Mobile domain name to to the document root of the mobile installation.

* var
    * www
        * html
        * gibbon
        * mobile
        
If your school runs the gibbon software with the school website, then in this example the following would be appropriate expectation of the final result:

| Domain Type          | Host URL                    | Document Root          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| School Domain        | http://www.myschool.edu/    | /var/www/html          |
| Gibbon Domain        | http://gibbon.myschool.edu/ | /var/www/gibbon        |
| Gibbon Mobile Domain | http://mobile.myschool.edu/ | /var/www/mobile/public |

Change to your new directory and run the composer require command.  This will install the package for you, complete with all dependencies.
